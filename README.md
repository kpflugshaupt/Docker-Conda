# Docker-Anaconda
Dockerized version of Anaconda for easy analyses.

This repo uses docker to build an [Anaconda 3](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3/) container. Existing projects can be saved to `/projects` and will be available in the container. A Jupyter server will be started by default and can be accessed at https://localhost:8888.
